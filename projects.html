        <h2>1) High-Speed Beverage Can End Manufacturing Reliability</h2>
        <p class="small"><strong>Context:</strong> Anheuser-Busch — Aluminum soda &amp; beer can ends (lids)</p>
        <p><strong>Engineering problem:</strong> unplanned downtime, scrap generation, and quality instability on 24/7 high-speed presses supplying major beverage brands.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supported high-speed can-end presses operating at extremely high stroke rates in a Tier-1 supplier environment.</li>
          <li>Performed RCA on mechanical and electrical press faults; identified repeat failure modes impacting uptime and downstream filling operations.</li>
          <li>Updated preventive maintenance intervals, inspection points, and operator work instructions while supporting live production.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Results (resume-safe):</strong> improved uptime consistency, reduced scrap through earlier defect detection, and increased production stability on continuous-run equipment.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>2) Casting Design &amp; Solidification Simulation</h2>
        <p><strong>Engineering problem:</strong> mitigate shrinkage/porosity/incomplete fill risk before tooling.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed casting geometry with gating and risers.</li>
          <li>Ran flow + solidification simulations to predict fill behavior, hot spots, and shrink risk.</li>
          <li>Iterated design based on simulation feedback to validate manufacturability before pours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Value:</strong> DFM + virtual validation to reduce scrap/cost; data-driven iteration with ProCAST-style tooling.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>3) Aerospace Investment Casting Process Engineering</h2>
        <p class="small"><strong>Context:</strong> Consolidated Precision Products (CPP)</p>
        <p><strong>Engineering problem:</strong> aerospace-grade requirements where defects are unacceptable.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supported investment casting processes for aerospace components under strict quality constraints.</li>
          <li>Evaluated process steps impacting dimensional accuracy and defect formation.</li>
          <li>Supported production troubleshooting and continuous improvement initiatives with documentation discipline.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small"><strong>Note:</strong> specific components not shown due to proprietary/export-controlled considerations.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card full">
        <h2>4) Welding Process Monitoring &amp; Quality Control</h2>
        <p><strong>Engineering problem:</strong> inconsistent weld quality and limited traceability across production welding operations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented a Miller weld monitoring system to capture voltage, current, and time.</li>
          <li>Used the data to identify out-of-spec conditions, improve consistency, and support traceability/documentation.</li>
          <li>Worked with operators to integrate monitoring without disrupting throughput.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> improved process control and faster feedback on weld conditions.</p>
